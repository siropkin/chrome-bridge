Set up chrome-bridge — the bridge that lets you drive my real, logged-in Chrome — and install your end of it. Do every step yourself and tell me the result of each. The only thing I do is the one-time extension load in Chrome (step 3).

1. Pick the repo root `<repo>`:
   - if your working directory is already a chrome-bridge checkout (it contains `cli.mjs` and `AGENTS.md`), use it;
   - else if `~/chrome-bridge/cli.mjs` exists, run `git -C ~/chrome-bridge pull --ff-only` (if the pull fails, show me the error and keep the existing copy) and use `~/chrome-bridge`;
   - else clone it and use `~/chrome-bridge`:

     ```
     git clone https://github.com/siropkin/chrome-bridge.git ~/chrome-bridge
     ```

     (if the clone fails — e.g. `~/chrome-bridge` exists with other content — show me the error and stop; don't delete or move anything)

   Substitute `<repo>` with the real path everywhere below.

2. Bring the bridge up on this checkout's code (needs Node ≥ 18 — if Node is missing or older, tell me and stop; don't install or upgrade anything yourself):

   ```
   node <repo>/cli.mjs stop
   node <repo>/cli.mjs start
   node <repo>/cli.mjs health
   ```

   (`stop` reporting "nothing was running" is fine; the stop-then-start pair guarantees the server runs the code you just fetched, not some older copy from another location — a loaded extension reconnects on its own.)

   - health prints a ⚠ line saying the loaded extension's version differs from the repo → ask me to reload the extension at `chrome://extensions`, then re-run health.
   - health reports `"extension":true` (with no ⚠) → jump to step 4.
   - health reports `"extension":false` → step 3. But if the extension was connected before your restart, wait ~10s and re-run health once first — it reconnects on its own after a server restart.
   - server won't start → show me the error and the last lines of `<repo>/server.log` (if it exists), then stop.

3. The one click only I can do: ask me to open `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer mode, click Load unpacked, and select the `<repo>/extension` folder. On macOS you may run `open -a "Google Chrome" "chrome://extensions"` first. Then poll `node <repo>/cli.mjs health` every 5s (up to ~90s) until it reports `"extension":true`; if it doesn't, tell me what's still missing and stop — don't keep polling.

4. Install your integration — pick the ONE that applies to you:
   - Claude Code — copy the skill so it auto-loads on browser tasks in every project (use `./.claude/skills/` instead of `~/.claude/skills/` only if I told you to scope it to this project):

     ```
     rm -rf ~/.claude/skills/chrome-bridge && mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && cp -r <repo>/.claude/skills/chrome-bridge ~/.claude/skills/
     ```

   - any other agent (Cursor, Qwen, GLM, Kimi, …) — append this line to the instructions file you read at session start (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, …; create it in the project you're working in if none exists), but only if it's not already there. If your instructions live somewhere you can't edit, print the line and tell me to paste it there:

     ```
     To drive my Chrome browser (real logged-in tabs), read <repo>/AGENTS.md and run `node <repo>/cli.mjs <command>`. If the health check fails, run `node <repo>/cli.mjs start`; if the extension is disconnected, tell me to reload it.
     ```

5. Tell me the bridge is up. From the next session your integration auto-loads; in this one, read `<repo>/AGENTS.md` when a browser task comes up.
